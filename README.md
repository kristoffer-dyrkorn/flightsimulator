- Synthesized, dynamic engine sound
- Gamepad support (limited to USB connected gamepads and Chrome)

Warning: The code is not beautiful.

## Running

To run using local terrain data, download and prepare the data sets by following the instructions in `sh`-files in the `scripts/` folder and then running the scripts.

To run using already provided data sets, just open the file `src/index.html`.

Starting point location (in UTM 33 N coordinates) and altitude (in metres) can be provided as the url parameters e (UTM east), n (UTM NORTH) and a (altitude). Example: `index.html?e=120300&n=6959500&a=2000`.

## Controls

- Keyboard: Arrow keys for aileron and elevator. z and x for rudder. q and a for throttle.
- Gamepad: Right joystick for aileron and elevator. Lower left and right front buttons for throttle.

Rendering and keyboard control is tested in Firefox, Chrome and Safari on OS X, and in Edge on Windows 10.
Gamepad control is tested in Chrome on OS X, using both Steelseries Nimbus and Xbox One gamepads (both being connected by USB cable).
